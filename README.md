The main idea was to provide a new, really cool, way to visualize the ResearchLogger provided data. With that in mind, the objective was surpassed, by far.

Here a cool idea can be seen, where each of the user events are seen as books. More inmersive that the next visualization idea, but less expressive.

And here is the definitive way the data ended up being visualized, where squares are the sentences written by the users, and the spheres the mouse events.
In turn each of this objects can be interacted with, by clicking it: That promts a web explorer with a website that shows the exact event that was clicked on, and the two next to it. This event isshown inside a timeline, and in the case of it being a click event it shows a screenshot of the moment of the click. In the case of a sentence it shows the written sentence on screen

At the end of the day it was a cool project to work with. It helped to build on top of ResearchAnalyzer, and to have a lot of fun while doing so. Extra mid-development pic:
